# TIC80 Template

I use this to start my games in TIC80.

Only works with the pro version of TIC80. You can buy it on [itch.io](https://nesbox.itch.io/tic80) or sponsor the developer on [github](https://github.com/sponsors/nesbox?o=esb).

## How to use (on mac)

1. Clone this repo into `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/com.nesbox.tic/TIC-80`

2. Open or Load the template.lua into TIC80.

3. Have fun!
